## **Overview**
The project aims to provide a robust and scalable trading platform using modern microservices architecture. Each service is responsible for specific tasks, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## **Architecture**
The project is designed as a monorepo, with all microservices contained within the `services` directory. The architecture is containerized using Docker and is ready for deployment on Kubernetes.
